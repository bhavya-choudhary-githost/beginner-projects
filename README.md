Hello there!  

This repository contains some of my early learning projects — small scripts and experiments that helped me build a foundation in programming. These projects also helped me understand the importance of good documentation.

  - `html/`: This is a messier folder but i have no desire to fix it
  - `css/`
    - `css.md`: Notes on css

- `Scripts/`
  - `python_easter_eggs.py` — Hidden and fun Python syntax quirks
  - `f_string_speed_comparison.py` — Timing different string formatting methods
