            [Verse 1]
There's nothing colder than your shoulder
When you're dragging me along like you do, like you do
And then you switch up with no warnin'
And you kiss me like you want it, how rude, how rude

[Refrain]
But I kinda like it anyways
I don't mind if this is gonna take a million days
I know you'll come around to me eventually
If you sit back, relax, and join my company, my company

[Pre-Chorus]
Once you know what my love's gonna feel like
Nothing else will feel right, you can feel like
Moonbeam ice cream, taking off your blue jeans
Dancing at the movies, 'cause it feels so

[Chorus]
Mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know, once you know
My love is so mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know, once you know

[Verse 2]
My little hard-to-get baby
I wanna give you the world
Not saying you gotta chase me
But I wouldn't mind it
If you gave me just a little bit
Of something we can work it with
But all you do is push me out (Ha)

[Refrain]
But I like it anyways
'Cause I think I'm getting closer to you every day
I know you'll come around to me eventually
Just sit back, relax, and join my company
Oh, baby, trust me

[Pre-Chorus]
Once you know what my love's gonna feel like
Nothing else will feel right, you can feel like
Moonbeam ice cream, taking off your blue jeans
Dancing at the movies, 'cause it feels so

[Chorus]
Mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know, once you know
My love is so mystical, magical
Oh, baby, 'cause once you know, once you know

[Outro]
(Once you know what my love's gonna feel like)
(Moonbeam ice cream, nothing else will feel right)
Mystical, magical
Oh, baby, it's mystical, magical
